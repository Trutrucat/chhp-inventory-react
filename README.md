## Summary
CHHP Inventory App is a project I have started to make for my current employer. It is to replace thier pencil and paper method of taking inventory each week for their restaurant. I seperated it into sections based on thier current inventory system because the employer likes to have several employees take inventory each week at the same time splitting up the sections so that it's not all falling on one person. I felt this could be a very useful app because we could all use our phones to input the information instead of having to carry a pencil and paper into a walk-in freezer and find a place to write! 

## Stretch Goals
I would like to do a lot more with the styling. I would like to add a pheasant logo at the bottom of each page as well as implement a grid system that looks like a spreadsheet for the items. I would also like to add a target quantity along with the current quantity. I would like to make an admin user who has access to all of the information as well as reordering information. I would like to make it so that only the admin can add or delete items and the rest of the users can only edit quantities.
